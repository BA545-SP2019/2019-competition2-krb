For feature selection (suggest a tree based (RF or Extreme Tree))
    -correlation is too weak
    - rfe isn't good enough, have to try the others


Grid Search CV --> specify a list of values for the hyperparameters and ti runs through them
    --good starting point --> build one for Random Forrest, Build One for XGboost
    
    
-data robber --> will find the best model for me

Spend some time on running the models and seeing if they are doing well. 




At the end of the day, one person should continue to do EDA
one person 




look at single males, single females, married males, married females


For the final presentation, Tao will be the client (bank) and what will our scenario be? Are we consultants? etc...
        we need about a week for this 
        
Model/Tweaking/EDA needs to be done at this point 


I will do the models


The most important things is if we can tell a good story, this is like a minincapstone project. 

The objective of the project is to tell a story--can use tableua or whatevr we want


Maybe some additional EDA--maybe do some clustering

!/3rd of presentation will be background, 1/3 on EDA, 1/3 on models

Consulting suggestions maybe? 


**** Come up with a gameplan **** 


Clustering Model for single males between 20-30

If the outstanding debt is going up every month, down every month, or stay the same. Use clustering on this and see what would lead to a default pattern



cluster age, sex, marriage, etc... 


the auto encoder part will be for the credit usage per month (bill amt - pay amt)/bill amt) --> the differnece is if this goes up/down/stays the same
maybe check debt --> this would be a seperate auto encoder

our AC vectors would be 6 variables long [ 1 for eahc month and defualt for the next month ]

maybe try a convuluted auto encoder (will help woth denoising)
